    "We now turn to numerical _integration_, also known as _quadrature_. \n",

    "There are many examples in physics involving computing integrations, and we will not list them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem to be solved\n",
    "More generally, the task of quadrature is to evaluate $\\int_a^b f(x) dx$, for a function $f(x)$ which may look like that in @fig-fx.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The definite integral is the area under the curve, when $x$ goes from $a$ to $b$](week11_files/fx.png){#fig-fx}\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical integration at its most fundamental consists of approximating a definite integral by a sum, as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_a^b f(x) dx \\simeq \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i f(x_i).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, the $x_i$ are known as the _nodal abscissas_ and the $c_i$ are known as the _weights_. Note that the $i$ runs from $0$ to $n-1$, so we are dealing with n abscissas (and $n$ weights) in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such quadrature methods can be divided into three categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we have _closed method_, where the endpoints of our interval ($a$ and $b$) are included as abscissas ($x_i$). The trapezoid and Simpson's methods are closed. \n",
    "- Second, we have open methods, where the endpoints of our interval ($a$ and $b$) are _not_ included as abscissas ($x_i$). The midpoint method and Gaussian quadrature are open.\n",
    "- Third, these are half-open methods, where one of the endpoints of our interval ($a$ or $b$) is not included in the abscissas ($x_i$). Of the approaches we discuss below, the rectangle method is half-open. It's easy to see that open or half-open methods are to be preferred in the case where the integrand has a singularity at an endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also group the several integration methods according to a different criterion, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Newton–Cotes methods**: these make the assumption that the integral can be approximated by summing up the areas of elementary shapes (e.g., rectangles); such methods typically involve _equally spaced abscissas_: these are useful (if not necessary) when $f(x)$ has already been evaluated at specific points on a grid. \n",
    "- **Gaussian quadrature**: these make use of unequally spaced abscissas: these methods choose the $x_i$ in such a way as to provide better accuracy. As a result, they typically require fewer abscissas and therefore fewer function evaluations, making them an attractive option when an $f(x)$ evaluation is costly."
