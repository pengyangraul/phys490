    "# Gaussian Quadrature\n",
    "In previous lecture, we studied the Newton-Cotes methods which employ an evenly spaced grid. In contradistinction to this, what the _method(s) of Gaussian quadrature_ accomplish is both simple and impressive: instead of limiting yourself to equally spaced nodal abscissas, _expand your freedom so that both the $n$ abscissas $x_i$ and the $n$ weights $c_i$ are at your disposal_.  Then, you will be able to _integrate all polynomials up to degree $2n - 1$ exactly_!\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be straightforward to see why this is impressive: it implies that even using a very small number of points (say $n = 5$) allows us to integrate all polynomials up to quite high order exactly (up to ninth order for $n = 5$). As you may have already guessed, the reason this is possible is that we have doubled the number of parameters at our disposal: we can use the $2n$ parameters (the $x_i$’s and the $c_i$’s) to handle polynomials up to degree $2n - 1$.\n",

Now, for the discussion of Gaussian quadrature, we will employ it _directly_ in the full interval from $a$ to $b$. \n",
