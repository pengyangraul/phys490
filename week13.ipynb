    "### Importance Sampling\n",
    "In this section, we will show that we can even introduce weight functions by hand even the integrand appears to be a single (i.e. unweighted) function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_a^b f(x) dx = \\int_a^b w(x) \\frac{f(x)}{w(x)} dx = \\int_0^{b-a} \\frac{f(x(u))}{w(x(u))}du \\simeq \\frac{b-a}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{f(X(U_i))}{w(X(U_i))}.\n",

    "- In the first equality we multiplied and divided with a positive weight function of our choosing. \n",
    "- In the second equality we used the change of variables as we did previously.\n",
    "- In the thrid equality we treated $f/w$ as our (\"unweighted\") integrand and therefore used $U_i$s which are uniformly distributed from $0$ to $b-a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process is known as _importance sampling_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why we went through the trouble of doing this. The answer is as follows: if you choose a $w(x)$ that behaves approximately the same way that $f(x)$ does,then your random numbers will be distributed in the most \"important\" regions, instead of uniformly. To put the same idea differently: since our (unweighted) integrand is $f/w$, the variance will be computed with $f/w$ in the place of $f$. Since $w(x)$ is chosen to be similar to $f(x)$, we see that $f/w$ will be less varying than f itself was; this will lead to a reduction of the variance, i.e., a better overall estimate of the integral we are trying to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in action, we turn to the example we've been revisiting throughout numerical integration, namely we integrate the following function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "from 0 to 1. We can plot it in the following (blue solid curve)."

    "1.  Every $n_m$ steps, make a \"measurement\", i.e., evaluate $f(\\boldsymbol{X}_i)$. Because the Markov chain samples are not statistically independent, we are computing the sample mean (and its variance) using not every single sample, but every $n_m$-th one. This is done in order to eliminate the correlation between the samples.\n",
